iMac Insanity.

We had changed the timetable this week for the final 6 weeks of term though to me that seemed a bit pointless and unnecessary but the show must go on and it did. The point of that was to way we had moved classroom to IT1 from IT2 which means we had iMAcs which I don't really like using. In this lesson we had to finish off the different tutorials so all I had to do was a quick final timing one which allows for me to finally know how to make a timer with the micro:bit. 

 The rest off the lesson was spent planning for our own microbit game and mine was a labyrinth game involving three different levels and I did this working with two other people those being Rhys and Rory.
