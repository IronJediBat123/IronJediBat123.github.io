Coding Cover Lesson

 This lesson was quite fun but fairly sad. It was sad because as sir was not in today whether it being him ill or having to do a meeting I wish for him to be back for next week. Our cover teacher was Miss Collis who we always have as our cover teachers.

Though on the other side it was extremely fun as we continued with what we did on our computers was continuing on what we were doing last week. This was doing a lot of the tutorials on the mico-bit website and that was really fun.

 This taught me not much more this lesson as we learnt a lot about it the last lesson so I was a bit disappointed.
