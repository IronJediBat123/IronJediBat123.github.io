**IT Final term - lesson 1**

   This lesson we used a website called ripl.it which uses the coding language python and it helps to teach people how to use it when coding. Using this we first drew 3 shapes; a square, a triangle and a pentagon which was quite easy. Then we had to write out the three initials of our name which was also completed in the lesson. 

   I learnt by following the teachings of our teacher who is currently Mr Tansley due to the rotary system that we have for the teachers at our school. This was coupled with the self "teachings" of how to use python as well as some basic problem solving. This I feel may not have been the most successful way to learn but it was still a quite good one.

   During this lesson I wasn't hindered that dramatically by anything at all though I do think that I could have paid more attention to my work and chatted a bit less even though the chatting did in some cases help me with my work.

  Next lesson I will attempt to try and work on the things that I failed on in this lesson so I will most likely attempt to only speak when I need help from either my peers or my teachers though any other time I will remain silent to try and work more efficiently.
