E-Safety: Return Of The Fun

This lesson had a lot of different things happening throughout it we started of by going through last week's homework which I was very proud of myself for as I got a very good mark on. 

 Then we moved on to a very fun activity that was unfairly cut short by Eshen being silly again. The activity was that sir would read out a question about the media and then depending on our answer we would stand on a different side of the room, this was one of my favourite activities that we have done in all of  IT during all of my time at school  which is why I was so annoyed at Eshen when he made us have to stop. 

  This also caused us to miss out on the next activity which we never found out what it was which is probably for the best as if we did find out what we missed out on we would just  regret missing out on it even more.

   Then we moved on to go back into the middle of the room to discuss how that companies don't always tell you the truth, the prime culprit of this is McDonalds as their Big Macs on the advert have been computer altered to make it seem that their burger are the perfect burger when in reality they are not. We then  went on to discuss more about other adverts and then we were told our homework and. the lesson was done
