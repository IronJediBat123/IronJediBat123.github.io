Illuminati Attacks

Today was the day of the attack of the Illuminati as we began to talk about how that when the black on the whiteboard and how it wasn't actually black but void  what it was. 

 Then it all went down hill with Jack Morgan asking about a theory but accidently said conspiracy theory giving rise to the question "what's a conspiracy theory?" 

so then we started to talk about the Illuminati was. After that Mr keen clicked on a website about the illuminati then vzzzpt the power cut 

we  had a long conversation about what to do  then sir told us we will learn binary and hex colours which is what we did for the entire lesson.

 I learnt how to write in binary which is what the only way for computer to count with 0s and 1s and that is why binary exists.  The we did stuff on how to add  with binary which i found very  easy .

The we moved on to hex numbers which is how you colour through using code this was quite simple then we were still out of power until P.E. which, luckily, was the next lesson.
