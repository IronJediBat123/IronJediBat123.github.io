Game Coding

This lesson began with us posting every single piece of coding tutorial on to google classroom along with a web link to our current blog for the IT lessons at the moment.

 We began to do a lot of the actual code for the games we were making until I had hit a wall with my knowledge of how to code. This lead me to start to check previous pieces of code I have made allowing for me to enhance my learning.

In this lesson I learned how to use previous work to help me learn in the future lessons.
