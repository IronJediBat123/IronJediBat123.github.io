    <td>Once more I have used my three step process and it was very efficient. I worked well with this and it was very useful. My three step process has definitely been an efficient and industrious method towards working and learning using codecademy.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>There was nought that stopped my work this lesson and I was efficient for the entire lesson. The only habit that I will need to be working on for next lesson are to try to work more independently and rely on help less.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Next lesson I will change nothing in my working style as I worked well this lesson though as previously mentioned I will try to work  more independently.</td>

Sorry for the lack of work I wasn't sure what to put as I have my method sorted and it will be how I work for the future.
