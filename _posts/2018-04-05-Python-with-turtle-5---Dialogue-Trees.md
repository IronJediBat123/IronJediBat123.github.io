    <td> This lesson there was not much to be learnt from the coding side of things but what little there was to learn I still tried my best to learn that. This was achieved by simple trial and error for example whenever I attempted to work out the reason why a particular piece of code wasn't working though it usually just turned out to be a piece of punctuation like a colon missing or a misspelt word which is easy to solve.</td>

    <td>     There was nothing that limited my learning this lesson apart from my eagerness to continue which will often lead to mistakes in spelling, punctuation or grammar which means I will need to slow down and that in turn would make my work faster.</td>
