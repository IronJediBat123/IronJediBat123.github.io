E-Safety: Keep To Yourself

This lesson started with us going over last week's homework as we did last week.We also checked google classroom to see who had handed in the last weeks homework but it turned out that I had done it wrong but I wasn't the only one that hadn't done it correctly. 

 The next thing that we went on to was categorising the advantages to having social media and the disadvantages to having social media. Amongst the advantages were being able to talk to clients or old friends via video chat or texting. Though the advantages far outweighs the  disadvantages but there still are disadvantages.  There was the fact that ISIS could send propaganda out via Twitter and Facebook, there is also cyberbullying and grooming (which is when a person starts to tell someone of a young age that what they got told was wrong and then starts to make them believe something else).

After that we watched a couple of videos on how to speak better by dropping the likes and ums in your speech as it could affect your job in the future. 

Then sir gave us our homework then the lesson was over.
