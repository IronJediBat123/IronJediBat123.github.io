    <td>Once more I learnt using my 3 step process but also I was a lot more indecent and logical in my working out of the problems I faced learning using Codecademy. My independence was also a key factor in my learning as although I worked slower and achieved less I know that I learned a lot more in this week then I did in other weeks.

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Despite me learning more due to my independence I worked slower and over all learned around the same so maybe I should try to factor in my speed of previous lessons in this lesson as well as working more independently than the previous weeks.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>As previously mentioned I will try to work faster to improve my learning but also I may try to work cooperatively as well as working independently. This I hope will help to accelerate both my speed of work and the amount of code I have learned.</td>
