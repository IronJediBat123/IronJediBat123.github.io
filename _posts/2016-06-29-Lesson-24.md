**Micro:Bits have arrived!**

After many many many weeks of waiting the Micro:Bits had finally arrived causing us to waste 35 minutes of the lesson just getting those to begin to work. This was very fun and enjoyable with one extremely and incredibly  special added bonus. I WAS THE FIRST PERSON IN OUR CLASS TO GET ONE. A fact that I was truly humbled by to be given the opportunity to have that title awarded to me.

 The final 25 minutes of our lesson was spent on introducing us to our new topic. Which I think is on online safety. Though I am not entirely sure on this so I will check after this with a member of the class. Our homework was to find two articles one being that on sexting and the other revenge porn which I don't really understand the thought process behind. Then we had to post that link onto the blog post after reading through the article.

So here are mine.

 Sexting = https://www.theguardian.com/society/2015/nov/10/sexting-becoming-the-norm-for-teens-warn-child-protection-experts

 Revenge Porn = http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/law-and-order/11531954/What-is-the-law-on-revenge-porn.html
