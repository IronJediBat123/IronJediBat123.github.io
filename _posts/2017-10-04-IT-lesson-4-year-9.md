Cover-Lesson

   This lesson was a cover lesson all the work we had to do was just put up on the board and told that that is what we had to do for homework if it wasn't finished in class. This is a way of working that I really enjoy and find it to be a good way to learn compared to the teacher just telling the class what to do in little sections then calling for those that are finished to the front to tell them the next piece of work.  That meant that the way that I worked in this lesson was just to copy stuff down from the board or to do a bit of simple problem solving to complete the work. Despite this next lesson I hope that there may be a bit more challenge in the work 

   Nothing hindered my working this week apart from having to help a few people with their work ,which I was okay with because it didn't take long to fix their problems, and nothing else meaning that these situations combined with the scenario I requested at the end of the previous paragraph are the best scenarios for me to be working in I feel.

   I can do nothing to improve my way of working next week but hope for the work to be a bit harder so that it will require a bit more problem solving in the vein of our codecademy work as that was hard enough to challenge us but not too hard for the work to be impossible. This could also be coupled with having a  better mentality towards my lessons as in previous lessons I was annoyed by the lack of work set and the confusing way homework was done as I first thought that it was homework to finish off the stuff from the lesson but it turns out that was not the case. I could also do a bit more practise at home.
