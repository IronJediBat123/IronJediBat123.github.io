Cover-Lesson

    This lesson was a cover lesson all the work we had to do was just put up on the board and told that that is what we had to do for homework if it wasn't finished in class. This is a way of working that I really enjoy and find it to be a good way to learn compared to the teacher just telling the class what to do in little sections then calling for those that are finished to the front to tell them the next piece of work.  That meant that the way that I worked in this lesson was just to copy stuff down from the board or to do a bit of simple problem solving.

   Nothing hindered my working this week apart from having to help a few people with their work and nothing else meaning that these situations combined with that of the previous paragraph are the best ways for me to be working in.

   I can do nothing to improve my way of working next week but hope for the work to be a bit easier so that either people won't be stuck on it or I could work through it faster and then  have more time to help other people.
