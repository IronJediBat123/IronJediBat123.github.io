(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>No I didn't as my 'Aâ€™ for my middle name was very difficult and I struggled to get it correct.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>   I learnt in the same format that I had from last lesson which was to try and draw things out on a piece of paper then scale it up to fit correctly on the computer I'd had great difficulty with the A once again so I could not complete it but I still manage to complete the C and H using this method so I think it is quite a successful method.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>   Once more the things that limited my learning was the lack of understanding of the variables that would be applied to the code. This code would help me to learn more as I can further my learning quickly.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>   Once more I will try and further my knowledge of maths to help me learn the variables and work out how to perform the code a lot easier.</td>
