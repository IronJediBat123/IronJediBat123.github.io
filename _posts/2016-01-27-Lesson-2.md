Blog Begins 

 Today in IT we started off by finding out what we needed to do in the lesson (which we never got on to doing), which was making sure we had a specific theme on our blog. Then Mr Keen opened up a link from inside of mattvh/jekyllthemes which included a piece of latin. This lead to him searching up what it meant on wikipedia  because of what Eeshan Saund said "you should never trust wikipedia". This spawned Anish to say about a person going on wikipedia's Liverpool and changing it to offend fans of the club.

  Then sir went on a rant about how outrageous premier league football is and how that one child swore at another child about a team that the other supported loss at a game of football. Then he told us about how he once got beaten up because of the fact that he supported a team that was different  to what they supported.  

   After those stories he got us to put up our hand on levels of trust  for first wikipedia then told us why we should trust it. The we had to do the same thing for BBC NEWS and then told us why we shouldn't. 

    Then we had a conversation about types hackers most specifically anonymous. Eventually we got told about our homework and ended the lesson.

    From this lesson I learnt how to make my very own blog and not to trust everything you are told.
