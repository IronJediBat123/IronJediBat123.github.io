    <td> This lesson I worked the same as the last few weeks and this is clearly successful as my ability to code has been getting better and better. I can tell this is happening because although the work I can see is clearly more difficult yet the ease of work has been consistent lesson to lesson.</td>

    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>

  <tr>
    <td> The work has increasingly become more and more difficult with this lesson being no exception. The work was challenging yet it has taught me lots about how to code using Python. And once again I am only limited by the amount of time in the lesson.</td>

  <tr>
    <td> Next time if I get stuck on a tricky piece of coding I will follow my new 3 step solution. It goes like this, Step 1 - Engage my brain, step 2 - Ask a friend and the final step step 3 - is google the exercise. When googled In will have the answer and work out how that answer was derived.</td>
