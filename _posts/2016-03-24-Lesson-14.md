Prezi Planning

 This lesson started with us going to the centre of the room straight off the bat and sir was asking about whether or not we had done the project that we got as homework this week, so obviously we hadn't done it. 

 Then we moved on to finding out about a mysterious thing called Prezi and what a Prezi is it's a better form of presentation than Microsoft PowerPoint which isn't hard to beat. Sir then opened up the Prezi website and showed us an advertisement for Prezi and it was very interesting though kind of odd. We were then talking about the lack of anything exciting if you used a PowerPoint presentation in a  big important board meeting.

We first signed in using our challoners okta sign in. After that we moved on to making our own Prezis which I found really fun when we got to make our own ones. In order to do this successfully sir said we had to do it in a specific order the order was; Start a blank Prezi, Find a colour scheme that fits your project or make one of your own, get images to back up some information and have interesting information and finally to put the information in. We then got to have fun with a random Prezi and to have fun on it. 

 This lesson taught me how to make a Prezi which helped me with my homework and with any presentation I may do in the future.
