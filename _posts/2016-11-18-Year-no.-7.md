    <td>Today I had done a lot of hands on and no work reading out as punishment dealt by Tate for forgetting my memory stick which I will go into in the next paragraph. This was so much better to work on and to teach me more about the way that the coding works.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>I was very silly in how I came into the lesson by forgetting to take my memory stick causing Tate to be very annoyed at me for the majority of the day until I asked Ludo (a friend of mine) if we could borrow his memory stick which he allowed as his partner had one. This prevented us to continue our work that we did from the last week but this also allowed us to speed along in the work that we were to do. So all I need to do is remember to bring my memory stick then work will be easy once more.</td>
