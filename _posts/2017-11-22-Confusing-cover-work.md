Confusing cover work

   This lesson was a cover lesson and we had a cover teacher who I didn't know what his name was though the lesson was still a good one and in order to get his attention was to call "Sir".

   In this lesson we had one very simple task that I was unsure why that would be to add to the spreadsheet which if you compare the two of the different spreadsheets from the last week and this week then you'll see the added work. All that is the addition of a reverse to what was added last week (when I had to catch up on the work as I was ill) this being a decoder from a piece of encoded work. Once this was completed I moved on to work on something of my own choice which was adding onto a piece of translation for an already encrypted piece of code.

   This lesson there was little that prevented me from working well; I was persevering from all of my issues and problems that I had with my sheet, I was focussed and finished my work quickly and as well as this I helped some people with my work. Though for some reason there are people that haven't kept up with their work so they ask for help which in turn prevents me from working. 

   Next lesson if I don't really know how much I can change the way that I work but maybe I could try to work with other people to try and excel my working.
   
  This is the current look at my blog.
