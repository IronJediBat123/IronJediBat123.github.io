    <td>   This lesson I worked hard and fast which was very efficient. This was because I pretty much ignored the rest of the class and just worked on my codecademy. Also we were not interrupted by Mr Ampah-Korsah and did not work on our blogs at all this lesson just on codecademy. This coupled with my amazing three step process allowed for my work to be both speedy and great for my learning.</td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>   This lesson I could have tried to work more as a team with Jack Morgan, who sits next to me and is very good at coding as I believe his dad works in the computing industry. That could be a habit for me to work on in year 9.</td>

    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>   Next year I will hopefully be a lot better with this kind of coding as I will be doing some work on this over the holidays which I think is homework. That is how I will improve my learning by putting in some extra time to try and further my knowledge of this subject.</td>
