    <td> This lesson I worked the same as the last few weeks and with the addition of of using last week's 3 step plan to remind you this is how it goes. Step 1 - Engage my brain, step 2 - Ask a friend and the final step step 3 - is google the exercise. When googled In will have the answer and work out how that answer was derived. This was great and it accelerated my progress greatly and I learnt lots more.</td>

    <td> This lesson’s work was easier than last weeks and I worked well with nothing in my way so I will work the same as this lesson. Meaning that there was little that limited my learning and next lesson I won’t have to change my working pattern.</td>

    <td>For the next lesson I don't plan on changing anything as I was fast and efficient so next lesson I will only change my learning by accident and won't have planned it.</td>
