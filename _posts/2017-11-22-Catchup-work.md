   As I was ill for the lesson for this week and that meant that I had to catch up with the work from this lesson which was easy.

   The way I had to work in this catch up session was to get all the work from a friend of  mine but then I had to work out what all the code meant the most confusing code that I found was a piece that said RIGHT(Left(( then code for what you wanted it to do went in here. This I still don't quite know what it meant but I could understand how that worked. There were also some other pieces of code that are quite useful these include 'if’ and ‘is error’ which are both useful pieces of code.
