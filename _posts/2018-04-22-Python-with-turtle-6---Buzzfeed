    <td>   The way that I learnt this lesson was by having some hands on experience with what I was meant to be working with the permission of our teacher of course, this hands on work was going over quizzes like the one that I would eventually be making these quizzes were on websites like buzzfeed and others of their ilk. This I felt was effective as once we'd learned the actual code of how to work the quizz then all I had to do was get what sort of questions would be asked and what sort of answers should be given.</td>

    <td>     This lesson nothing limited me as I did nothing that in anyway resembled work atleast without any context as I was just messing around online to help me work with the aforementioned research so I suppose that a habit I could work on is not just working on the direct problem but thinking of a more unique way to solve the problem.</td>
