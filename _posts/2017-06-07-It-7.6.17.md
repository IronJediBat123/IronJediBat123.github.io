Decomposition

   This lesson was a change of style for how we learned. This was that we joined our lesson with the other year 8 class that I think was 8B, but I am not sure. We were led by Mr Keen and not by Mr Ampah-Korsah as he was not in school at all.

   We learnt about how to decompose coding by comparing it to a real world example, this being making a cup of tea. This we all said out in the order that we would make it in. This we assumed would be right but then sir read it out and it seemed unbelievably stupid. Then cutting it down to the first step, filling up the kettle. This was then explained how it would have to be told in order to get a robotic arm to do that. That topic ended in about 10 minutes due to lots of questioning being done. That lead to me to think "Why question it? Sir is going to be correct." Then the lesson went a bit off topic. Actually it went very off topic. I can't remember how we got onto it but we started to discuss how that the colour i perceive to be red isn't necessarily the same colour that another mans red is

   From this lesson I didn't  really learnt much but reiterated facts I already knew so this lesson was a sort of general knowledge revision lesson.
