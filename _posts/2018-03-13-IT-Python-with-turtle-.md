    <td>   In this lesson I learnt by following the instructions given by my teacher and also by drawing everything out on a piece of paper then measuring it in real life then just putting those numbers into the programming website. This I felt was a very successful way to learn how to code and also help me learn how to code python</td>

    <td>   Things that limited my learning was my general lack of understanding of how to work out the information that is required to fill in the code to make it actually work. </td>

  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>   I may need to do some more revision on the mathematical side of coding this will allow me to actually focus on the actual coding ide of our learning which will allow me to learn the proper code and I can then learn fr better than I have in the past few lessons.</td>
