Reviewing Prezis

Today we began the lesson by heading into the center of the classroom and going over the half term homework and who had done it correct. I had done it correctly but I hadn't got off scot-free I had been annoying sir without it being on purpose by asking far too many questions on Google Classroom. 

 We then looked at a Eeshan's Prezi as he hadn’t handed it in properly for homework which wasn’t very good as it would go all over the screen and not like mine that was in a perfectly chronological order and went from left to right. We were then given our task for the lesson and that was to do a review sheet of our blog and we had to review a friend’s blog. I reviewed Rhys’ blog and vice versa. 

The categories were; the colour of the blog, the icon for your blog, the text layout, the amount of blog posts, the spelling/grammar of blog posts, the quality of blog posts and the length of the blog posts. We were also three pieces of advice for improving our blog posts. We did that until the end of our lesson and we were then giving our homework and we left.

 I learnt that not everything that I do at first glance is perfect and I should always go over things first.
