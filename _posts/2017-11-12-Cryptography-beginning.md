   This lesson we began our learning of cryptography which was a topic that I found both interesting and fun due to the nature of the cryptography that we are doing. We are currently programming a chaser cypher A.K.A a shift cypher. Which is when the letters of the alphabet all shift a set amount of letters either backwards or forward. They are written by having a positive or negative symbol then a number (+/- x). The x is the number you want to move the letter e.g. 3 would make A D or X then a positive or a negative will make it go either forward or a negative will make it go backwards. This is what I learnt from today's lesson as well as the beginnings to how the spreadsheet that will contain all our work from this half term will look. Mine is shown at the bottom of the page.

   This lesson I was works well and with a fast pace and I had nothing to hinder my work in any way shape or form apart from a single problem that I've had with my spreadsheet. That is you have to enter a letter per 26 boxes shown in the spreadsheet this I will hope to have rectified by next week. Whether that is by going to one of Mr Keenâ€™s coding clubs at lunchtime or just by working it out by myself. Hopefully it will be the latter not the former. 

 I don't have much in the way of an idea to how I will improve my working next week as I feel this week was a good speed and a good level of learning to say that I had a successful lesson and all I can hope for is a continuation to how I worked this lesson.

This is what my spreadsheet looks like.
