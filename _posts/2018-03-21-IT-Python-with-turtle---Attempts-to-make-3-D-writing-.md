(add details to "Lesson Review")</td>
    <td>No I didn't as my 'A’ for my middle name was very difficult and I struggled to get it correct. I completed my bubble writing and just the ‘H’ was finished.</td>

    <td>   The things that limited my learning this time was the general annoyance of everybody in the classroom as there were no teachers in the room for a lot of the lesson. This is because Mr Tansley our normal teacher was away so there was lots of rough </td>
