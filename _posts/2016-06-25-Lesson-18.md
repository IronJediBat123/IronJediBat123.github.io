Coding Craziness

 This lesson began with sir showing how to complete the homework but I was rather annoyed as for some reason my work had changed. This was weird as both James and Matt had the same problem as I did.  

 After that we moved on to finding out our task for the lesson and it was to complete all of the tutorials on the BBC Micro Bit when we worked with our partners who mine was Rhys as it has always been. We managed to get through to the fourth out of six. 

 These tutorials were very difficult but also taught me huge amounts of information on the Micro Bit's JavaScript coding and now I am a lot better than before we started this topic.
