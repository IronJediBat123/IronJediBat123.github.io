Micro-Bit Madness

This lesson began with us going straight into the middle of the classroom to take part in a discussion about the Prezis we did. We had a short discussion about how we we weren't aloud to talk very loud. This was because of the GCSE examination in the room next to us sir even threatened to keep us in for the entirety of lunch if it got out loud. 

 Then we moved on to having a quick tutorial on how to program the BBC Micro Bit computing devices and then we got to play on the coding part of it on their website. I found this really useful as it has taught me so much about how to code and how to use a micro-bit.

 Thankfully sir said we only had to do a short blog post this week.
