Continuing Game Coding

This lesson was a very fun lesson that included  a lot of hard work to be able to fix the game that my group and I had been working on for the last couple of weeks. 

 We began the lesson by going into the center of the room and almost five people got told of for not doing the homework from a week ago. Despite me feeling bad for them it was quite funny to here there awful excuses for not doing the homework.

This lesson taught me how to code a video game on a maze for homework. This is used for moving a character to another spot on the micro:bit's display.
