    <td>I learnt by again swapping with Tate we changed it up this week and despite it being his turn he allowed me to start off on the FUZE box. This was a lot of fun to do as the coding is a lot more fun than the reading out to help Tate. Again this was fun and could teach me lots about the way to code games and also many of the pieces of coding.</td>

    <td>The work we were working through was very difficult and was hard to complete from the sheer amount of coding that was required to make a fairly ok game about guessing the computer's number but it was fun to see a game that I made from the ground up. There are no habits that I need to work on just being efficient.</td>

This week I improved my blog by completely and utterly changing the theme of my blog. Though it hadn't worked.
