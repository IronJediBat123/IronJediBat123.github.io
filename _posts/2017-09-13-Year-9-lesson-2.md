Lesson 2-Easy work

   This lesson all we had to do was further our basic google sheet by just adding a few of the more technical and real world formulae and techniques. These included using a code decided by me to represent the chosen items to sell.

   This lesson for me was actually quite fun and exciting as I found the work very easy as well as very simple. This was due to how that I could keep on top of it all last lesson then this lesson the majority of the work was just to finish off the work form the last lesson. Then we were told to do a very simple addon that I finished off quickly which then led me to decide to decorate my sheet to make it allot more easy to interpret all the data on it.

   My learning was only hindered by the fact that I wasn't given as much work as I could’ve done or would’ve hoped for as I do enjoy furthering my learning in all manner of ways.

   Next lesson I hope that the work set just challenges me a lot more than the work from this week because as I have previously mentioned it was very simple and far too easy as although I did learn I didn't feel challenged and didn’t learn as much as I feel that I could've and was not expected compared to other lessons from Mr Keene.
