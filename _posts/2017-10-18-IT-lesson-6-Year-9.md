Completely off topic

   This lesson was strange as the only way for us to work was to listen to sir speaking for the first 40 minutes of the lesson. This was not bad as if it was 40 minutes of talking about the google sheets that would have been bad but instead we were learning about supercomputers. This lead on to us talking about the strength of our passwords and mine are relatively secure I learnt. Though if you have a 8 character password then the most powerful supercomputer in the world will take 1/13 of a second use brute force (when you try all the possible combinations) to hack the computer. The final 20 minutes was just trying to update my blog and the google sheets we've been working on. Though I somehow had managed to spend that 20 minutes helping other people rather than working on mine thought that I was fine with that.

   This lesson nothing hindered my work, it was a fun and enjoyable lesson in which I learnt plenty of mostly irrelevant stuff though that is fine. Next lesson if I focus on my own work more I will probably be able to learn more.

   Next lesson I will hopefully be able to work better as we will be on the countdown to christmas and it will be after half term so I will be in a very good mood as christmas is the best so I will be in a very good mood and also I will not be as tired as I seemingly always am when I'm going to school (even though I will have been going to school for 3 days). I will also try and focus more on getting my work done rather than attempting to help other people as if they need help then I won’t be able to help them as I won’t have completed that work.

 This is what my google sheets looks like now with the profit and loss sheet completed.
