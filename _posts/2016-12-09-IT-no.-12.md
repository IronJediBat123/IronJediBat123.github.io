    <td> I learnt by changing up the way Tate (my partner) and I worked. If you would recall for every single week before today we had done one person reading out and the other doing the typing whereas this week we alternated every exercise. This was a method that I preferred a lot and I hope that Tate wants to do this in the future weeks.</td>

  <tr>
    <td> Limiting my learning this week was the annoyance of other people. By this I mean that those that aren't in our class that for some reason they think it is ok to damage the schoolâ€™s equipment. This obviously angered Mr Keen and he told the whole group of us off which took roughly 5 - 10 minutes meaning we had only roughly 45 minutes.</td>
