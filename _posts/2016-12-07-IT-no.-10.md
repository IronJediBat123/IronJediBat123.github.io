    <td>I was very grateful for Tate's lack of concentration allowing me to finish the flashing lights exercise and a good chunk of a second one that I really enjoyed doing. This exercise was on how to work a light sensor this is a new yet somewhat impractical tool for me but I did enjoy reading up about them to find out what they were.</td>

    <td>This lesson I was efficient and without distractions allowing for great levels of progress to be made and I really enjoyed doing this weeks work. Unfortunately the class was an incredibly fast feeling one so I couldn't work any more on it so I will just have to wait until next week.</td>
