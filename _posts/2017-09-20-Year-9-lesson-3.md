**Lesson 3-Little work to do**

**20/09/17**

   This lesson we learned very little new as once again people were behind and we had to wait for people to catch up with those that had done wall the work. What little we learned was a small piece of code that is comcalulate which just puts two or more separate pieces of code or a string (a piece of code in between two speech marks that makes it into a piece of text and not a piece of code). Then we just messed around with the cost of delivery and the added price of VAT. 

   As previously mentioned my learning was heavily hindered by the amount of time taken by those behind and that in turn lead to sir having to go round and help and not instruct us with what we needed to do and what pieces of the work we needed to do meaning my and other's learning was stunted by the speed at which others worked. This, I feel understandably, I was annoyed by.

   Nexty lesson I am unsure about how I am going to improve on where my learning was hindered as it was completely out of my control. Despite this hindrance I shall make an effort to keep up the same level of effort and standard that I worked up to today.
