Coding Tutorial

 This lesson was already a more eventful lesson than last lesson as we had already found out that we had Mr Keene again. 

 For the majority of the lesson we were again continuing with the coding tutorials this taught me a lot about how to make the various maze games on the micro-bit. Nothing eventful happened in our lesson apart from finding out our homework was to do a whopping one hour and thirty minutes of continuing on the micr-bit tutorials which is alot of homework.
