    <td>I learnt by working quickly on the easy exercises, that I did quickly within 15 minutes roughly leaving the other 40 minutes on trying to use make the burglar alarms flash as well as making a sound which I found very exciting when it first happened as it was unexpected and exciting.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>Habits that I could  work on are; to use my iPad if I get stuck on something that is more difficult and requires more adaptability of a previous set of code, I could also have asked a group that is ahead of Tate and I but unfortunately there are no groups ahead of us that could help as the 2 groups that are ahead of us are barely ahead of us. </td>
