Awkward Conversations 

This lesson was incredibly awkward as it all began with our homework being assessed by the class. We were discussing what we learned from reading through the articles we had chosen for the homework. This was very interesting and I learnt a lot from it. 

 This was easily the least awkward part of the lesson. Then we were informed of the legal problems of both revenge porn and setting which brought sir to mention an erection which caused the awkwardness to dial up to 11. This caused the question what is an erection which was answered simply with it is a boner. Then Ben said "when someone has an erection don't they w!'k" which caused to be rather shocked me to be incredibly shocked as that was not the Ben I knew from Robertswood (our previous school).  This lead more awkward conversation and more hilarity to come.

 From this lesson I learned very little apart from what had been previously stated. This is because I had already done sex ed at my previous school so little was learned.
