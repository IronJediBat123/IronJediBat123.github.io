E-Safety: The Media Strikes Back

This lesson we moved on from the e-safety lessons and talked more about the concept of media of all descriptions so using newspapers, social media(e.g.instagram Facebook and the like).

 In the lesson we had to fill in a sheet that contained several different statements concerning media both traditional and social media. This was quite hard to complete the sheet  as we had to go around the class finding people to put as our answer for the questions. I enjoyed this as I found out a lot more about my friends even though they could easily have lied about those facts.

 Sir started to talk about media and how that if you are not old enough to be able to get a facebook account then you shouldn't. 

Then we watched a kia advert, this advert was quite a humorous advert as it was about a trio of hamsters that were quite incredibly fat then had to get thin for their red carpet event. Then we had to analyze this advert as we had to do for our homework. That took up the rest of our lesson.
