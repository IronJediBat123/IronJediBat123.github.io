        E-safety: A New Topic

Today we started work on our E-safety skills. We did this by discussing why you should never put your essential information on a website. This is because that could allow a man that has peculiar sexual preferences A.K.A. a pedophile to find out who you are, then we did the unspeakable we asked a question!!!!

  As soon as a member of our class asks a question in IT we completely lose track of what we are doing in that lesson and this lead us into one of the most uncomfortable lessons in my entire school life. The whole lesson was on what not to do if you come into the situation of a being groomed( when somebody starts to tell you about how all you know of in life is wrong and tell you to listen to what they believe. They then convince you that is the truth and that is what life is about). The answer to that is tell the nearest person of authority in your life. After that there was a lot of stories of people that were groomed. 

The we moved on to talking about pornography and how the different laws apply to different people. For example different laws apply to Mr Keene, me and my dad considering relationships and pornography.

 That was all we did in the 5th lesson of IT in challoners
