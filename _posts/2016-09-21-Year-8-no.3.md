    <td>This lesson I learnt in a much more hands on approach for today's lesson. This is because I did the coding and my partner Tate was reading out the instructions. This was a lot more effective than my previous learning strategies as I felt myself learning and being able to remeber lots of the ways to code like making loops or variables.</td>

  <tr>
    <td>What limited my learning? Which habits do I need to work on? </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>This lesson there was very little that prevented my learning this lesson. Though there were quite a few moments where either Mr Keen or Mr Ampah-Korsah would tell people off or just a message that stopped the coding of me and my peers.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>What will I change for next time? How will I improve my learning?</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Next time I will try to improve on my concentration in the lesson to enhance my learning to its maximum capacity. This allows for more coding to be completed hence forth more learning to be done.</td>
