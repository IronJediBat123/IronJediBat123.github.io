   Hello, I am Charlie Hinds. I'm a film and gaming enthusiast. Here you can read up on my lessons at Dr Challoners Grammer School. I've been learning lots of stuff to do with computing and society for almost 2 years now and I've learnt a wide variety of useful tools in both life and using computers.
